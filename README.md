# React-parcel-boilerplate

Boilerplate for small React applications. Hot Module Replacement, test, css reset and autoprefixer, react router, scss, styled-components etc...

I decided to speed up my workflow process when i want to code fast for app prototypes using React.js so i created this package.
Feel free to share it and give feedback.

- Fast config
